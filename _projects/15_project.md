In the functional programming course, I studied foundational topics in functional programming using OCaml, with a focus on program correctness, data structures, and concurrency. Due to the closure of the Bitbucket server, the code is temporarily unavailable.

**Course Contents**  
1. **Correctness of Imperative Programs**
2. **Fundamentals of Functional Programming with OCaml**
   - Values, variables, functions
   - Data structures, pattern matching
   - Higher-order functions
   - Polymorphic types
   - Queues
3. **Programming at Scale**  
   - Modules and functors
4. **Correctness of Functional Programs**
5. **Concurrency**  
   - Channels and rendezvous
