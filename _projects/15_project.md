In the software engineering course, I completed a 10-week coding assignment covering key areas such as software design principles, version control, unit testing, and agile development practices. The primary development language used was Java.

In the functional programming course, I studied foundational topics in functional programming using OCaml, with a focus on program correctness, data structures, and concurrency.
