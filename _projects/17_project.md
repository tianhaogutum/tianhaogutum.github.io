From September 2024 to October 2024, I worked as a research assistant, contributing to projects including the 83 Code and CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) optimization. In this role, I engaged in developing and testing algorithms to enhance error-detection capabilities and improve computational efficiency for digital systems. My work involved:

- Conducting data traffic tests in CRC development to verify that the teamâ€™s new algorithm demonstrates superior performance.
- Finding matrices for the 83 Code project that minimize computational costs in redundancy calculations.

This position allowed me to deepen my expertise in data verification techniques and contribute meaningfully to the advancement of robust and efficient coding strategies for high-reliability applications.
