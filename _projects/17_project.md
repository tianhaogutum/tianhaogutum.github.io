From September 2024 to October 2024, I worked as a research assistant, contributing to projects including the "83 Code" initiative and CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) optimization. In this role, I engaged in developing and testing algorithms to enhance error-detection capabilities and improve computational efficiency for digital systems. My work involved:

- Conducting analysis on CRC algorithms to identify optimization opportunities that reduce computational load while maintaining error-detection accuracy.
- Assisting in the development of "83 Code," focusing on improving data integrity and resilience within large-scale distributed systems.
- Collaborating with senior researchers to document findings and implement prototype solutions.
- Running simulations and stress tests to validate the performance improvements of optimized CRC processes.

This position allowed me to deepen my expertise in data verification techniques and contribute meaningfully to the advancement of robust and efficient coding strategies for high-reliability applications.
