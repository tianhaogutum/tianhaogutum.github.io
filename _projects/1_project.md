## iLabX - The Internet Laboratory  

### Overview of the iLabX Course

The Internet connects nearly everything we rely on today. In the iLabX course, I delved into the mechanisms powering the Internet, learned essential protocols, and gained hands-on experience building a fully functional Internet environment within a virtual lab.

### Course Structure & Content

This self-paced course allowed me to structure my own study schedule, allocating 4-6 hours per module across six comprehensive parts:

- **Signals and Cables**: Explored physical transmission mediums (twisted pairs, optical fiber), signal encoding, and data transmission fundamentals.
- **Internet Protocol (IP)**: Learned about IPv4 and IPv6, subnetting, routing protocols, and IP address configurations.
- **Routing**: Mastered dynamic routing, Autonomous Systems, and the algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford) that guide data paths.
- **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and UDP**: Examined data reliability, congestion control, and the stateful communication mechanisms of TCP/UDP.
- **Domain Name System (DNS) and Web Servers**: Set up a DNS, configured a web server, and secured the server with HTTPS protocols.
- **NAT, DNS64/NAT64, and Firewalls**: Applied Network Address Translation, configured NAT64 and DNS64, and implemented firewall rules for network security.

### Hands-On Experience

Using a virtual Internet laboratory, I set up actual Internet protocols to establish my own simulated Internet environment. This allowed me to apply real-world Internet mechanics, from signal encoding to web server configuration and beyond. The course’s interactive elements, including practical exercises and projects, allowed me to gain functional knowledge on topics such as IP forwarding, DNS zone configuration, and firewall management.

### iLabX Highlights

- **Interactive Laboratory**: Built a virtual Internet environment with real tools used in industry.
- **Flexible Learning**: Tailored learning experience with videos, written content, and practical tasks to reinforce each topic.
- **Expert Insights**: Included a feature interview with Vint Cerf, co-inventor of the Internet, discussing the network’s origins and future.
