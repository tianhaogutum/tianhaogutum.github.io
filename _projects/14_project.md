In the algorithms and data structures course (IN0007), I studied foundational concepts in computer science, including complexity analysis, data structures, and algorithmic techniques. Due to the closure of the Bitbucket server, the code is temporarily unavailable.

**Course Content Overview**

1. **Fundamentals of Algorithms and Data Structures**
2. **Complexity Analysis** (efficiency measures, Big O notation, machine models)
3. **Data Structures for Sequences** (arrays, lists, stacks, queues)
4. **Hashing** (chaining, universal hashing, open addressing, perfect hashing)
5. **Sorting Algorithms** (SelectionSort, InsertionSort, MergeSort, QuickSort, lower bounds for comparison-based sorting, order selection, RadixSort, external sorting)
6. **Priority Queues** (binary heaps, binomial heaps)
7. **Search Structures** (binary search trees, AVL trees, (a,b)-trees)
8. **Graphs** (representations, BFS and DFS traversal, connectivity, topological sorting, shortest paths, minimum spanning trees)
9. **Pattern Matching** (naive search, KMP algorithm)
10. **Optional: Data Compression** (Huffman codes, Lempel-Ziv algorithm)
