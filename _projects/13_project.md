In the software engineering course, I completed a 10-week coding assignment covering key areas such as software design principles, version control, unit testing, and agile development practices. The primary development language used was Java. In the computer architecture course (IN0004), I studied foundational topics related to computer organization and system design.

2. Machine instruction set and assembler  
3. Microprogramming  
4. Formal description of computers using VHDL  
5. Combinational logic circuits  
6. Sequential circuits  
7. Memory hierarchy  
8. Concepts of modern microprocessors  
9. Introduction to "Advanced Computer Architecture"
