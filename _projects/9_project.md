In the software engineering course, I completed a 8-week coding assignment covering key areas such as software design principles, version control, unit testing, and agile development practices. The primary development language used was Java. Due to the closure of the Bitbucket server, the code is temporarily unavailable.

**Course Content**  
Software engineering involves the systematic use of engineering principles for developing large, complex software systems. Key topics covered include:

- **Modeling with UML**
- **Software Development Process Models** (linear, iterative, agile)
- **Requirements Analysis** (functional, dynamic, and object models)
- **System Design** (software architecture, architectural patterns, design goals)
- **Object Design and Implementation** (reuse, design patterns, interface specification)
- **Testing** (component, integration, and system tests)
- **Software Configuration and Release Management**
- **Software Maintenance and Evolution**
- **Project Organization and Communication**
