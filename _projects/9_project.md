In the software engineering course, I completed a 10-week coding assignment covering key areas such as software design principles, version control, unit testing, and agile development practices. The primary development language used was Java.

**Course Format and Expectations**  
- Lectures and tutorials are online, with no on-campus events.
- Interactive lectures and exercises encourage active participation, both in-class and over livestream.
- Bonus points are awarded for completing exercises and homework successfully.
- Students are required to use their own computers during the lecture and in virtual tutor groups.
- Experience with Java OOP and an IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ) is mandatory.

**Intended Learning Outcomes**  
Upon completion, students will understand the basic concepts and methodologies of software engineering phases, including problem modeling, class and component reuse, and software delivery. Students will be able to select and apply relevant methods for specific problems and will be familiar with essential software engineering terms and workflows. They will also be able to solve concrete problems using design patterns and other techniques.

**Course Content**  
Software engineering involves the systematic use of engineering principles for developing large, complex software systems. Key topics covered include:

- **Modeling with UML**
- **Software Development Process Models** (linear, iterative, agile)
- **Requirements Analysis** (functional, dynamic, and object models)
- **System Design** (software architecture, architectural patterns, design goals)
- **Object Design and Implementation** (reuse, design patterns, interface specification)
- **Testing** (component, integration, and system tests)
- **Software Configuration and Release Management**
- **Software Maintenance and Evolution**
- **Project Organization and Communication**

**Teaching and Learning Methods**  
Through animated slides and interactive lectures, the course introduces core software engineering concepts, supplemented by quizzes and modeling/programming tasks. Tutorials reinforce understanding through team exercises and practical applications. Homework enables self-study and practice, with individual feedback helping students gauge progress and improve skills. Presenting solutions in tutorials also enhances communication skills, critical in software engineering.

**Media Used**  
- Digital slides, live stream, online exercises (programming, modeling, quizzes) with feedback
- Communication platform (Zulip) for interactions among instructors, tutors, and students
