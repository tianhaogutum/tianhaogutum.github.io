In the IT security course, I completed a 9-week coding assignment covering key areas such as cryptographic algorithms, network security protocols, vulnerability assessment, and access control mechanisms. The primary development language used was Python.

**Course Content**  
- Basic terms in IT security  
- Selected security issues in current systems and related attacks  
- Fundamentals and practical methods in applied cryptography  
- Basic concepts and protocols for identification/authentication, access control, and system security  
- Fundamentals of network security: firewall concepts and practical network security protocols  
- Methods in operational IT risk and security management (ISM)

**Teaching and Learning Method**  
Lectures are supplemented by exercises with practical components, including assignments designed to deepen understanding of conceptual and technical issues through specific tasks and simple programming exercises.

**Media and Literature**  
- Lecture slides  
- Recommended Literature:
