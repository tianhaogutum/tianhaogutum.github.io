In the software engineering course, I completed a 10-week coding assignment covering key areas such as software design principles, version control, unit testing, and agile development practices. The primary development language used was Java.

**Course Overview**  
This course covers fundamental and advanced concepts of modern C++ programming. Topics include:

- **Basic C++ Language Concepts**: Syntax, strong typing, and type deduction.
- **Build Systems and Dependency Management**: Automatic compilation, linking, dependency management, continuous testing, and integration.
- **Resource Management**: RAII, smart pointers, universal references, ownership, and copy/move semantics.
- **Procedural Programming**: Functions, parameter passing, lambdas, overloads, and error handling.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, inheritance (single and multiple), and polymorphism.
- **Generic Programming**: Templates, variadic templates, fold expressions, and patterns such as CRTP.
- **Compile-Time Programming**: Template recursion, constexpr, and type traits.
- **Containers and Iterators**: STL containers, iterator concepts, and views.
- **Optional**: Parallel programming concepts (threads, atomics, async/futures).
- **Future Outlook**: Upcoming C++ concepts like Metaclasses and Concepts.
