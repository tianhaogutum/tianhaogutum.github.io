In the database course, I completed a 10-week coding assignment covering key areas such as database schema design, data querying and optimization, and transaction management. Due to the closure of the Bitbucket server, the code is temporarily unavailable.   

The course introduces fundamental database concepts and essential knowledge for practical database use. Topics covered include:

- **Core Database Concepts**: Covering essential theories and application knowledge.
- **Database Schema Design**: Structuring data for efficiency and integrity.
- **Data Querying and Optimization**: Learning methods to retrieve and manage data effectively.
- **Transaction Management**: Ensuring data consistency and handling potential conflicts during data operations.
