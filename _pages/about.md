## Welcome to My Digital Hub! 👋

Hi, I'm **Tianhao Gu**, a proud native of **Chengdu, China**—the land of hot pot and adorable pandas! 🐼 🌶️

### My Journey 🚀

I began my epic quest to master German at the tender age of 12, and by 21, I had successfully emerged from the hallowed halls of the **Technical University of Munich** (TUM), one of Germany's top universities, with a degree in Computer Science.

Let's be real: coming from an ordinary family, this journey has been more challenging than trying to eat spicy hot pot without breaking a sweat! But thanks to my **stubbornness**, **adaptability**, and an unhealthy dose of caffeine ☕, I made it through and feel incredibly proud.

### Living in a Tech Revolution 🤖

While I was busy decoding algorithms and solving complex problems, **ChatGPT** popped onto the scene, and I realized I was living through a genuine tech revolution. I'm fortunate to have developed a unique blend of:

- 🌍 **International perspective** from my cross-cultural experiences
- ⚡ **Youthful energy** and fresh approaches to problem-solving  
- 🧠 **Rapid learning ability** that's faster than a hot pot boils (seriously, it's like a superpower!)
- 💻 **Technical expertise** in Computer Science and Machine Learning

### What's Next? 📈

Now that I've got my diploma in hand, I know this is just the **opening chapter** of my adventure. Currently working as a **Research Assistant at Huawei** and serving as an **Honored Teaching Assistant at TUM**, I'm excited to see what the next plot twist has in store!

### Research Interests 🔬

- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**
- **Autonomous Systems & Robotics** 
- **Search-Based Testing & Optimization**
- **Network Systems & Protocols**
