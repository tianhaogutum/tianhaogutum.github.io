Hi, I’m Tianhao Gu, a proud native of Chengdu, China—the land of hot pot and adorable pandas (I mean, who can resist those little furballs?). I began my epic quest to learn German at the tender age of 12, and by 21, I had successfully emerged from the hallowed halls of the Technical University of Munich, one of Germany’s top universities, with a degree in Computer Science.
Let’s be real: coming from an ordinary family, this journey has been more challenging than trying to eat a spicy hot pot without breaking a sweat. But thanks to my stubbornness, adaptability, and an unhealthy dose of caffeine, I made it! And boy, do I feel proud (and slightly caffeinated).
While I was busy decoding algorithms, ChatGPT popped onto the scene, and I realized I was living in a tech revolution. I’m lucky to have a blend of international flair, youthful exuberance, and the uncanny ability to learn faster than a hot pot boils (seriously, it’s like a superpower).
Now that I’ve got my diploma in hand, I know this is just the opening chapter of my adventure. So, let’s see what the next plot twist has in store.
